| Auth Service | âœ… Complete | OAuth flows, token management, MFA support |
| Transport | âœ… Complete | HTTP transport, connection pooling |
| Groups Service | âœ… Complete | Group management, membership operations |
| Transfer Service | âœ… Complete | File transfers, recursive transfers, task management |
| Search Service | âœ… Complete | Search, advanced queries, batch operations |
| Flows Service | âœ… Complete | Flow execution, monitoring, management |
| Compute Service | âœ… Complete | Compute job submission and management |
| Documentation | ðŸ”„ In Progress | User guides, API docs need updates for interface changes |
| Tests | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Unit tests complete, integration tests in progress |
| Examples | âœ… Complete | All examples now compile successfully |
| Import Cycle Resolution | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Interface extraction pattern implementation ongoing |
| Credential Verification | âœ… Complete | Standalone verification tool implemented |
| Integration Testing | ðŸŸ¡ Waiting | Framework defined, awaiting import cycle resolution |

## Blockers and Known Issues

1. **Import Cycles**: We're implementing the interface extraction pattern to resolve circular dependencies between packages:
   - Created `pkg/core/interfaces` package with key interfaces
   - Added adapter implementations for connection pooling and authorization
   - Fixed version checking functionality with properly formatted code
   - Several import cycles remain between service packages and core interfaces

2. **Service Package Issues**: Some duplicate method declarations in service packages:
   - Fixed duplicate `RecursiveTransferOptions` type in transfer package
   - Fixed duplicate `tokenRequest` method in auth package  
   - Fixed test helpers to avoid conflicts with core functionality
   - Some duplicate declarations still need to be addressed

3. **SDK Compilation**: The SDK currently has compilation errors due to import cycles and incorrect imports:
   - The standalone credential verification tool allows testing while these issues are resolved
   - Some service implementations need to be updated to use the new interfaces

## Credential Verification Status

The standalone credential verification tool (`cmd/verify-credentials`) now has two implementations:

1. **Default Implementation** (`main.go` + `verify-credentials-sdk.go`):
   - Self-contained implementation that doesn't rely on the SDK
   - Uses the same API endpoints as the SDK would
   - Built by default with `go build`

2. **Standalone Implementation** (`standalone.go`):
   - Alternative implementation with identical functionality
   - Can be built separately if needed: `go build -o verify-credentials-standalone standalone.go`

This tool confirms that:
- Client ID and secret are valid for authentication
- Client credentials flow works for the Auth service
- Token introspection is working correctly
- Endpoint access can be verified (if endpoint IDs are provided)
- Group access can be verified (if group ID is provided)

## Testing with Actual Globus Credentials

To test with actual Globus credentials:

1. Create a `.env.test` file with your credentials:
   ```
   GLOBUS_TEST_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   GLOBUS_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
   GLOBUS_TEST_SOURCE_ENDPOINT_ID=source-endpoint-id
   GLOBUS_TEST_DEST_ENDPOINT_ID=destination-endpoint-id
   GLOBUS_TEST_GROUP_ID=group-id
   ```

2. Run the credential verification tool:
   ```
   cd cmd/verify-credentials
   go build
   ./verify-credentials
   ```

3. Once credentials are verified, they can be used for integration testing when that infrastructure is ready.

## Next Steps Before Release

1. **Complete Import Cycle Resolution** (High Priority):
   - Finish implementing interface adapters for remaining services
   - Update service implementations to use interfaces consistently
   - Ensure all import cycles are resolved

2. **Fix Remaining Compilation Issues** (High Priority):
   - Address any remaining duplicate declarations
   - Update test cases to work with new interfaces
   - Fix incorrect import paths

3. **Fix Remaining Test Issues** (High Priority):
   - Ensure all unit tests pass in all packages
   - Fix any failing tests in the token management package

4. **Run Integration Tests** (Medium Priority):
   - Implement the integration test script based on documentation
   - Run integration tests with verified credentials
   - Document any service-specific authentication requirements

5. **Final Documentation Updates** (Medium Priority):
   - Update README with current status
   - Finalize CHANGELOG for v0.8.0
   - Update user guides with interface extraction pattern details

6. **Release Artifacts** (Low Priority):
   - Tag v0.8.0 release on GitHub
   - Create release notes
   - Publish Go module

## Timeline

Based on current progress:
- Import cycle resolution: 1-2 weeks
- Fixing compilation issues: 1 week
- Integration testing: 1 week
- Documentation and release: 1 week

Estimated completion for v0.8.0 release: 3-4 weeks
