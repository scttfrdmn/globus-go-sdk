# Token Package Completion Report

## Overview

The `tokens` package has been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. This package provides robust functionality for storing, retrieving, and refreshing OAuth 2.0 tokens, which is crucial for web applications and other applications that need to maintain authentication state.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **Core Data Structures**
   - `TokenSet`: Represents a set of OAuth 2.0 tokens (access token, refresh token, expiry time, etc.)
   - `Entry`: Represents a token entry in storage with metadata

2. **Storage Interface**
   - Defined a clean interface for token storage operations
   - Implemented `MemoryStorage` for in-memory token storage
   - Implemented `FileStorage` for file-based persistent token storage

3. **Token Manager**
   - Implemented a `Manager` for token refreshing and management
   - Automatic token refreshing when tokens are close to expiry
   - Background refresh capability for proactive token management

4. **Webapp Integration**
   - Updated the webapp example to use the new tokens package

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite has been developed to verify the functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for core data structures (`TokenSet`, `Entry`)
   - Tests for storage implementations (`MemoryStorage`, `FileStorage`)
   - Tests for the token manager

2. **Features Tested**
   - Token storage and retrieval
   - Token refreshing
   - Background refresh
   - Concurrency handling
   - Error handling

## Documentation

The package has been thoroughly documented:

1. **Package Documentation**
   - Added package-level documentation with examples
   - Added comprehensive documentation for all types and methods

2. **README**
   - Created a README for the tokens package explaining its usage

3. **Implementation Notes**
   - Documented design decisions and implementation details

## Future Enhancements

Some potential future enhancements that could be made to the tokens package:

1. **Additional Storage Backends**
   - Redis-based token storage
   - Database-based token storage

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Token encryption at rest
   - More robust validation

3. **Metrics and Monitoring**
   - Token usage metrics
   - Refresh statistics

## Conclusion

The tokens package provides a robust foundation for token management in the Globus Go SDK. It addresses the dependency issue in the webapp example and offers a flexible, extensible solution for OAuth 2.0 token management.

The implementation follows the same design patterns as the rest of the SDK and should be easy to maintain and extend in the future.
