# API Stability Phase 3 Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing Phase 3 of the API Stability initiative for the Globus Go SDK. Building on Phases 1 and 2, Phase 3 focuses on CI integration, expanded contract testing, and enhanced verification mechanisms to ensure long-term API stability.

## Overview

Phase 3 will focus on integrating API stability verification into our CI/CD pipeline, expanding contract testing to all service packages, and implementing comprehensive test coverage for stability guarantees. This phase will prepare the SDK for the eventual v1.0.0 release.

## Key Components

### 1. CI Integration for API Stability

- **API Verification in CI Pipelines**:
  - Integrate `apicompare` tool into GitHub Actions workflows
  - Automatically generate and compare API signatures for PRs
  - Fail CI checks if breaking changes are detected without proper versioning

- **Automated Deprecation Reporting**:
  - Run `depreport` tool as part of CI pipeline
  - Generate deprecation reports for each PR
  - Track deprecation timelines and enforce deprecation policies

- **Version Enforcement**:
  - Implement semantic version validation in CI
  - Ensure version bumps align with API changes (patch, minor, major)

### 2. Expanded Contract Testing

- **Service Package Contracts**:
  - Extend contract testing framework to all service packages:
    - Complete `auth` package contracts
    - Implement `transfer` package contracts
    - Implement `flows` package contracts
    - Implement `search` package contracts
    - Implement `groups` package contracts
    - Implement `compute` package contracts
    - Implement `timers` package contracts

- **Interface Verification**:
  - Create contract tests for all public interfaces
  - Implement behavioral verification for complex interfaces
  - Add contract validation to CI pipeline

- **External Contracts**:
  - Define contracts for external API integrations
  - Implement verification for third-party dependencies

### 3. Enhanced Test Coverage

- **API Stability Testing**:
  - Create comprehensive tests for API stability guarantees
  - Implement test coverage targets for all packages
  - Ensure all public APIs have dedicated tests

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Expand integration test suite for all services
  - Implement cross-service integration tests
  - Add backward compatibility tests

- **Edge Case Coverage**:
  - Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
  - Implement stress testing for stability guarantees
  - Test deprecation warnings and behaviors

### 4. Documentation and Tooling

- **API Stability Documentation**:
  - Create comprehensive API stability guidelines
  - Document contract testing best practices
  - Add detailed documentation for stability verification tools

- **Stability Tooling Enhancements**:
  - Create visualization tools for API changes
  - Implement automated changelog generation
  - Add tooling for generating migration guides

- **Developer Workflow Integration**:
  - Provide pre-commit hooks for API stability checks
  - Create development workflows for API verification
  - Implement local validation tools

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 3.1: CI Integration (Target: v0.10.0)

- Week 1-2: Integrate API comparison tools into CI pipeline
- Week 3-4: Implement automated deprecation reporting
- Week 5-6: Set up version enforcement and validation

### Phase 3.2: Contract Testing Expansion (Target: v0.10.x)

- Week 7-8: Complete contract tests for auth and transfer packages
- Week 9-10: Implement contract tests for flows and search packages
- Week 11-12: Add contract tests for remaining service packages

### Phase 3.3: Test Coverage Enhancement (Target: v0.10.x)

- Week 13-14: Expand integration test suite
- Week 15-16: Implement API stability-specific tests
- Week 17-18: Add edge case and stress testing

### Phase 3.4: Documentation and Tooling (Target: v0.11.0)

- Week 19-20: Enhance API stability documentation
- Week 21-22: Improve stability tooling
- Week 23-24: Complete developer workflow integration

## Success Criteria

Phase 3 will be considered successful when:

1. API compatibility verification is fully integrated into CI/CD pipeline
2. Breaking changes are automatically detected during development
3. All service packages have comprehensive contract tests
4. Test coverage meets or exceeds targets for all packages
5. Documentation provides clear guidelines for maintaining API stability
6. Tooling supports efficient developer workflows for API stability

## Challenges and Mitigations

### Challenges

1. **CI Performance**: API comparison in CI may increase build times
2. **False Positives**: API verification may produce false positive breaking changes
3. **Test Complexity**: Contract tests may become complex and difficult to maintain
4. **Integration Overhead**: CI integration may require significant setup

### Mitigations

1. Optimize API comparison tools for performance
2. Implement configuration options to handle intentional changes
3. Create clear patterns and utilities for contract test implementation
4. Develop phased approach to CI integration

## Next Steps After Phase 3

Upon completion of Phase 3, the Globus Go SDK will have a robust API stability system in place. The next steps will include:

1. Final preparation for v1.0.0 release
2. Comprehensive API review and stabilization
3. Development of long-term support strategy
4. Implementation of advanced API evolution mechanisms

## Conclusion

API Stability Phase 3 will build upon the foundations established in Phases 1 and 2 to create a comprehensive API stability system integrated into our development workflow. This will ensure the long-term stability and reliability of the Globus Go SDK API, providing users with strong compatibility guarantees and clear migration paths when changes are necessary.
