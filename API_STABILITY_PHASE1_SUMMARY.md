# API Stability Implementation: Phase 1 Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 of the API Stability Plan for the Globus Go SDK.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Stability Indicators

We have added `doc.go` files with explicit stability indicators to the following packages:

- **pkg** (root package) - BETA
  - Overall SDK stability indicator with package listing
  - Provides version compatibility information
  - Links to documentation resources

- **pkg/core** - BETA
  - Clearly identifies stable components vs. evolving components
  - Highlights connection pool API as less stable
  - Documents compatibility expectations

- **pkg/services/auth** - STABLE
  - Lists all stable API components
  - Marks MFA components as BETA
  - Provides comprehensive usage examples

- **pkg/services/tokens** - BETA
  - Lists API components approaching stability
  - Documents expected timeline to stability
  - Integrates with existing package documentation

- **pkg/services/transfer** - MIXED
  - Clearly separates STABLE, BETA, and EXPERIMENTAL components
  - Provides appropriate warnings for experimental features
  - Includes usage examples for each stability level

- **pkg/services/groups** - STABLE
  - Documents the full stable API surface
  - Notes internal "LowLevel" methods as non-public
  - Demonstrates best practices for stable packages

- **pkg/services/compute** - BETA
  - Documents the function management API
  - Highlights workflow orchestration features as less stable
  - Includes detailed usage examples for common operations

- **pkg/services/flows** - BETA
  - Documents the flow management and execution API
  - Identifies batch operations as potentially evolving
  - Provides examples for all key operations

- **pkg/services/search** - BETA
  - Documents core index and search operations
  - Marks advanced query framework as potentially evolving
  - Includes usage examples for simple and advanced searches

- **pkg/services/timers** - BETA
  - Documents timer management and control API
  - Identifies error handling and scheduling as areas for refinement
  - Includes examples for various timer types and operations

### 2. CHANGELOG Enhancement

We have updated the CHANGELOG structure to better track API changes:

- Added explicit sections for:
  - Added (new functionality)
  - Changed (non-breaking changes)
  - Deprecated (scheduled for removal)
  - Removed (breaking changes)
  - Fixed (bug fixes)

- Improved documentation of API changes with:
  - More detailed descriptions
  - Links to related issues
  - Migration guidance

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates

We have enhanced the CLAUDE.md file with API stability guidance:

- Added a dedicated "API Stability Guidelines" section
- Documented the four stability levels (STABLE, BETA, ALPHA, EXPERIMENTAL)
- Provided guidance for working with the stability system
- Updated example prompts to include stability considerations
- Added code review guidance for API stability
- Updated best practices for stability-aware development

### 4. Release Checklist Development

We have created a comprehensive release process document:

- Detailed process for patch, minor, and major releases
- Pre-release verification steps
- API compatibility verification procedures
- Documentation finalization guidance
- Post-release validation measures
- Special handling for security releases
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues

### 5. Code Coverage Targets

We have defined code coverage targets for all packages:

- Established overall and per-package coverage goals
- Documented current coverage status (as of May 2025)
- Set phased coverage targets for v0.9.16, v0.10.0, and v1.0.0
- Identified critical packages requiring higher coverage
- Outlined implementation plan and testing strategies
- Specified approach for coverage monitoring and CI integration

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, we will proceed to Phase 2 of the API Stability Implementation Plan:

1. **API Compatibility Tool**
   - Develop a tool to verify API compatibility between versions
   - Integrate with CI pipeline

2. **Deprecation System**
   - Implement runtime deprecation warnings
   - Create utilities for marking and tracking deprecated features

3. **Contract Testing**
   - Add formal contract tests for core interfaces
   - Verify interface implementations

4. **CI Coverage Integration**
   - Add coverage tracking to CI pipeline
   - Set up automated reporting

5. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Set up tests to verify backward compatibility
   - Create test harnesses for cross-version testing

## Status Summary

Phase 1 of the API Stability Implementation Plan is now **COMPLETED**. All planned tasks have been executed and are ready for integration:

| Task | Description | Status | PR |
|------|-------------|--------|---|
| Package stability indicators | Add stability annotations to all packages | ✅ Completed | #15 |
| Release checklist | Create standardized release process | ✅ Completed | #16 |
| CHANGELOG enhancement | Restructure for better API change tracking | ✅ Completed | #15 |
| CLAUDE.md update | Add API stability guidance for AI assistance | ✅ Completed | #15 |
| Code coverage targets | Define per-package coverage requirements | ✅ Completed | #17 |

## Conclusion

Phase 1 implementation has successfully established the foundation for API stability in the Globus Go SDK by clearly communicating stability levels, documenting compatibility guarantees, and improving the change tracking process. These improvements provide users with clear expectations about API stability and compatibility, increasing confidence in the SDK and supporting better adoption and usage.

With the completion of Phase 1, we have laid the groundwork for subsequent phases of the API Stability Plan. The generated documentation, processes, and guidelines will guide all future development and ensure that the SDK maintains its stability promises to users.
