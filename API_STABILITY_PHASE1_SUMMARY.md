# API Stability Implementation: Phase 1 Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Phase 1 of the API Stability Plan for the Globus Go SDK.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Package Stability Indicators

We have added `doc.go` files with explicit stability indicators to the following packages:

- **pkg** (root package) - BETA
  - Overall SDK stability indicator with package listing
  - Provides version compatibility information
  - Links to documentation resources

- **pkg/core** - BETA
  - Clearly identifies stable components vs. evolving components
  - Highlights connection pool API as less stable
  - Documents compatibility expectations

- **pkg/services/auth** - STABLE
  - Lists all stable API components
  - Marks MFA components as BETA
  - Provides comprehensive usage examples

- **pkg/services/tokens** - BETA
  - Lists API components approaching stability
  - Documents expected timeline to stability
  - Integrates with existing package documentation

- **pkg/services/transfer** - MIXED
  - Clearly separates STABLE, BETA, and EXPERIMENTAL components
  - Provides appropriate warnings for experimental features
  - Includes usage examples for each stability level

- **pkg/services/groups** - STABLE
  - Documents the full stable API surface
  - Notes internal "LowLevel" methods as non-public
  - Demonstrates best practices for stable packages

- **pkg/services/compute** - BETA
  - Documents the function management API
  - Highlights workflow orchestration features as less stable
  - Includes detailed usage examples for common operations

- **pkg/services/flows** - BETA
  - Documents the flow management and execution API
  - Identifies batch operations as potentially evolving
  - Provides examples for all key operations

- **pkg/services/search** - BETA
  - Documents core index and search operations
  - Marks advanced query framework as potentially evolving
  - Includes usage examples for simple and advanced searches

- **pkg/services/timers** - BETA
  - Documents timer management and control API
  - Identifies error handling and scheduling as areas for refinement
  - Includes examples for various timer types and operations

### 2. CHANGELOG Enhancement

We have updated the CHANGELOG structure to better track API changes:

- Added explicit sections for:
  - Added (new functionality)
  - Changed (non-breaking changes)
  - Deprecated (scheduled for removal)
  - Removed (breaking changes)
  - Fixed (bug fixes)

- Improved documentation of API changes with:
  - More detailed descriptions
  - Links to related issues
  - Migration guidance

### 3. CLAUDE.md Updates

We have enhanced the CLAUDE.md file with API stability guidance:

- Added a dedicated "API Stability Guidelines" section
- Documented the four stability levels (STABLE, BETA, ALPHA, EXPERIMENTAL)
- Provided guidance for working with the stability system
- Updated example prompts to include stability considerations
- Added code review guidance for API stability
- Updated best practices for stability-aware development

## In Progress

The following tasks from Phase 1 are still in progress:

1. **Release Checklist Development**
   - Create formal release process documentation
   - Implement release verification checks

2. **Code Coverage Targets**
   - Define per-package coverage requirements
   - Document coverage expectations

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 1, we will proceed to Phase 2 of the API Stability Implementation Plan:

1. **API Compatibility Tool**
   - Develop a tool to verify API compatibility between versions
   - Integrate with CI pipeline

2. **Deprecation System**
   - Implement runtime deprecation warnings
   - Create utilities for marking and tracking deprecated features

3. **Contract Testing**
   - Add formal contract tests for core interfaces
   - Verify interface implementations

4. **CI Coverage Integration**
   - Add coverage tracking to CI pipeline
   - Set up automated reporting

5. **Compatibility Testing**
   - Set up tests to verify backward compatibility
   - Create test harnesses for cross-version testing

## Conclusion

Phase 1 implementation has successfully established the foundation for API stability in the Globus Go SDK by clearly communicating stability levels, documenting compatibility guarantees, and improving the change tracking process. These improvements provide users with clear expectations about API stability and compatibility, increasing confidence in the SDK and supporting better adoption and usage.
