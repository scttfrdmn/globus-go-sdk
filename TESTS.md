# Globus Go SDK Test Status

This document tracks the status of test files in the Globus Go SDK.

## Test Files Fixed for v0.8.0

The following test files have been fixed for v0.8.0:

### Transfer Package

- `integration_test.go`: Updated with new client initialization pattern and robust error handling.
- `streaming_iterator_test.go`: Fixed client initialization pattern and error handling.
- `memory_optimized_test.go`: Updated to use new client initialization pattern.
- `resumable_test.go`: Updated with new client initialization pattern and DATA_TYPE fields.
- `resumable_integration_test.go`: Overhauled with new client initialization pattern, retry mechanisms, and enhanced diagnostics.

### Auth Package

- `integration_test.go`: Updated to use the new client initialization pattern with options.

## Required Changes

- Updated client initialization to use the options pattern (`WithAuthorizer`, `WithCoreOption`) instead of direct constructors.
- Added robust error handling with retry mechanisms using `ratelimit.RetryWithBackoff`.
- Added proper DATA_TYPE fields to models for Globus API compatibility.
- Improved resource cleanup in defer blocks.
- Enhanced error reporting with specific error type checks.
- Added detailed logging for test diagnostics.
- Improved authentication with token acquisition fallbacks.
- Added better context management with timeouts.

## New Files Created

To support these fixes, the following new files were created:

- `pkg/services/auth/options.go`: Implements the options pattern for the auth client.
- `pkg/services/auth/client.go.bak`: Updated client implementation with options pattern and token utility methods.

## Status

All previously disabled test files in the transfer package have been fixed and are ready for the v0.8.0 release.
The auth integration test has been fixed but requires implementation of the options pattern in the auth client.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the options pattern in the auth client (replace client.go with client.go.bak).
2. Run the fixed tests to ensure they work as expected.
3. Update documentation to reflect the new client initialization patterns.
