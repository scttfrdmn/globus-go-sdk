# v0.10.0 Release Plan

This document outlines the plan for the v0.10.0 release of the Globus Go SDK. This release will focus on implementing API Stability Phase 3, enhancing test coverage, and preparing for the eventual v1.0.0 release.

## Release Overview

Version 0.10.0 represents a significant step toward a stable v1.0.0 release. It will include:

1. Initial implementation of API Stability Phase 3
2. Enhanced test coverage for all packages
3. CI integration for API compatibility verification
4. Expanded contract testing framework
5. Performance improvements for core operations

## Expected Changes

### Breaking Changes

The v0.10.0 release may include some breaking changes, particularly in the following areas:

1. **Client initialization**: Simplified client creation patterns
2. **API stability conventions**: Standardized stability indicators
3. **Configuration management**: Enhanced configuration options
4. **Error handling**: Consistent error handling patterns

All breaking changes will be documented in the migration guide, and automated migration utilities will be provided where possible.

### Deprecations

The following components will be deprecated in v0.10.0:

1. Old client initialization patterns
2. Legacy configuration options
3. Direct HTTP client access
4. Certain utility functions replaced by improved alternatives

All deprecations will include clear warnings and documentation on migration paths.

## Testing Strategy

Testing for v0.10.0 will include:

1. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for all packages
2. **Contract Tests**: Behavioral verification for interfaces
3. **Integration Tests**: Cross-service workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for core operations
5. **API Compatibility Tests**: Verification of API stability
6. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Testing with existing client code

## Documentation

Documentation for v0.10.0 will include:

1. **API Reference**: Comprehensive reference documentation
2. **Migration Guide**: Detailed guide for upgrading from v0.9.x
3. **Examples**: Updated examples for all services
4. **Tutorials**: Step-by-step tutorials for common workflows
5. **Best Practices**: Recommendations for usage patterns

## Success Criteria

The v0.10.0 release will be considered successful when:

1. All API stability Phase 3 components are implemented
2. Test coverage meets or exceeds targets
3. Performance improvements are measurable
4. Documentation is comprehensive
5. CI integration for API stability is complete
6. All breaking changes are properly documented
