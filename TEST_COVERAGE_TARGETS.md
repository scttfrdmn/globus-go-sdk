# Test Coverage Targets for the Globus Go SDK

This document outlines the test coverage targets for each package in the Globus Go SDK. These targets are intended to guide our test development efforts as part of API Stability Phase 3.

## Coverage Goals

We aim to achieve the following overall test coverage targets:

- **Core packages**: 90%+ coverage
- **Service packages**: 80%+ coverage
- **Utility packages**: 70%+ coverage

## Package-Specific Targets

### Core Packages

| Package | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| `pkg/core` | 85% | 95% | High |
| `pkg/core/auth` | 82% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/core/authorizers` | 88% | 95% | High |
| `pkg/core/config` | 76% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/core/contracts` | 92% | 95% | Medium |
| `pkg/core/deprecation` | 95% | 95% | Medium |
| `pkg/core/http` | 78% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/core/interfaces` | 65% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/core/logging` | 87% | 90% | Medium |
| `pkg/core/pool` | 50% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/core/ratelimit` | 85% | 90% | Medium |
| `pkg/core/transport` | 75% | 90% | High |

### Service Packages

| Package | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| `pkg/services/auth` | 82% | 85% | High |
| `pkg/services/compute` | 65% | 80% | Medium |
| `pkg/services/flows` | 70% | 80% | Medium |
| `pkg/services/groups` | 75% | 80% | Medium |
| `pkg/services/search` | 68% | 80% | Medium |
| `pkg/services/timers` | 72% | 80% | Low |
| `pkg/services/tokens` | 85% | 90% | High |
| `pkg/services/transfer` | 76% | 85% | High |

### Utility Packages

| Package | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| `pkg/metrics` | 60% | 75% | Medium |
| `pkg/benchmark` | 40% | 70% | Low |

## Testing Focus Areas

To achieve these coverage targets, we will focus on the following testing areas:

### 1. API Contract Testing

Implement contract tests for all interfaces:

- Complete contract tests for `auth.Authorizer` interface
- Add contract tests for `client.Client` interface
- Implement contract tests for `http.Pool` interface
- Add contract tests for service-specific interfaces

### 2. Error Handling Tests

Enhance error handling test coverage:

- Test all error paths in core packages
- Verify correct error wrapping and propagation
- Test service-specific error handling
- Verify error behavior with rate limiting and retries

### 3. Edge Case Testing

Add tests for edge cases and boundary conditions:

- Test with empty/nil inputs
- Test with large data volumes
- Test with various configuration combinations
- Test timeout and cancellation behaviors

### 4. Integration Testing

Expand integration test coverage:

- Add cross-service integration tests
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Test with real Globus API endpoints (with mocks as fallback)
- Test backward compatibility with previous versions

## Implementation Strategy

We will implement enhanced test coverage through:

1. **Gap Analysis**: Identify specific coverage gaps using `go test -cover`
2. **Targeted Tests**: Write focused tests for uncovered code paths
3. **Contract Tests**: Implement contract tests for all interfaces
4. **Mock Enhancements**: Improve mock implementations for testing
5. **CI Integration**: Add coverage reporting to CI pipeline

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked through:

1. Weekly coverage reports
2. PR-specific coverage requirements
3. CI integration for coverage enforcement
4. Periodic review of coverage targets

## Success Criteria

We will consider our test coverage goals achieved when:

1. All packages meet their target coverage percentages
2. All public APIs have dedicated tests
3. All error paths are tested
4. Contract tests are implemented for all interfaces
5. Integration tests cover key cross-service workflows

## Timeline

| Phase | Focus | Target Completion |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | Core package coverage improvements | v0.10.0 |
| 2 | Service package coverage enhancements | v0.10.x |
| 3 | Contract test implementation | v0.10.x |
| 4 | Integration and edge case testing | v0.11.0 |

## Conclusion

Achieving these test coverage targets will significantly enhance the reliability and stability of the Globus Go SDK. This comprehensive testing strategy aligns with our API Stability Phase 3 goals and will provide a solid foundation for the eventual v1.0.0 release.
