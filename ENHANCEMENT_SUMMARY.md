# Globus Go SDK Enhancements

## Summary of Improvements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Globus Go SDK to improve functionality, maintainability, and test coverage.

## Previous Enhancements

### 1. Token Validation Utilities

Added token validation utilities to provide a more robust way to work with Globus tokens:

- `ValidateToken`: Validates a token through introspection
- `GetTokenExpiry`: Gets the expiry time of a token
- `IsTokenValid`: Checks if a token is valid
- `GetRemainingValidity`: Gets the remaining validity duration of a token
- `ShouldRefresh`: Determines if a token should be refreshed based on a threshold

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Improved error handling for the Auth client with:

- Standard error types for common error scenarios
- Error checking functions like `IsInvalidGrant`, `IsUnauthorized`, etc.
- More consistent error wrapping and propagation
- Better error parsing from API responses

### 3. Additional Test Coverage

Added tests for:

- Transfer client functionality
- Token validation utilities
- Error handling
- Various edge cases

### 4. API Design Improvements

- Separated core interfaces to reduce circular dependencies
- Created adapter for proper interface implementation
- Ensured consistent context propagation 
- Added helper methods for client creation

### 5. Token Storage Interface and Implementations

Implemented a robust token storage system with:

- A `TokenStorage` interface defining standard operations for token persistence

### 7. Recursive Directory Transfer Functionality

Implemented recursive directory transfer capability:

## Implementation Highlights

### Token Storage

```go
// TokenStorage defines the interface for storing and retrieving tokens
type TokenStorage interface {
    StoreToken(ctx context.Context, key string, token TokenInfo) error
    GetToken(ctx context.Context, key string) (TokenInfo, error)
    DeleteToken(ctx context.Context, key string) error
    ListTokens(ctx context.Context) ([]string, error)
}
```

### Token Manager

```go
// TokenManager provides automatic token refreshing
type TokenManager struct {
    Storage          TokenStorage
    RefreshThreshold time.Duration
    RefreshFunc      RefreshFunc
    refreshMutex     sync.Mutex
}

// GetToken retrieves a token, refreshing if necessary
func (m *TokenManager) GetToken(ctx context.Context, key string) (TokenInfo, error) {
    // Implementation with automatic refresh logic
}
```

### Recursive Transfer

```go
// SubmitRecursiveTransfer submits a recursive transfer
func (c *Client) SubmitRecursiveTransfer(
    ctx context.Context,
    sourceEndpointID, sourcePath string,
    destinationEndpointID, destinationPath string,
    options *RecursiveTransferOptions,
) (*RecursiveTransferResult, error) {
    // Implementation with directory traversal and batching
}
```

### Resumable Transfer

```go
// CreateResumableTransfer creates a new resumable transfer
func (c *Client) CreateResumableTransfer(
    ctx context.Context,
    sourceEndpointID, sourcePath string,
    destinationEndpointID, destinationPath string,
    options *ResumableTransferOptions,
) (string, error) {
    // Implementation with checkpointing and batch processing
}

// ResumeTransfer resumes a previously created resumable transfer
func (c *Client) ResumeTransfer(
    ctx context.Context,
    checkpointID string,
    options *ResumableTransferOptions,
) (*ResumableTransferResult, error) {
    // Implementation with checkpoint loading and continuation
}
```
