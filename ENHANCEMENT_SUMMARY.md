# Globus Go SDK Enhancements

## Summary of Improvements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Globus Go SDK to improve functionality, maintainability, and test coverage.

### 1. Token Validation Utilities

Added token validation utilities to provide a more robust way to work with Globus tokens:

- `ValidateToken`: Validates a token through introspection
- `GetTokenExpiry`: Gets the expiry time of a token
- `IsTokenValid`: Checks if a token is valid
- `GetRemainingValidity`: Gets the remaining validity duration of a token
- `ShouldRefresh`: Determines if a token should be refreshed based on a threshold

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Improved error handling for the Auth client with:

- Standard error types for common error scenarios
- Error checking functions like `IsInvalidGrant`, `IsUnauthorized`, etc.
- More consistent error wrapping and propagation
- Better error parsing from API responses

### 3. Additional Test Coverage

Added tests for:

- Transfer client functionality
- Token validation utilities
- Error handling
- Various edge cases

### 4. API Design Improvements

- Separated core interfaces to reduce circular dependencies
- Created adapter for proper interface implementation
- Ensured consistent context propagation 
- Added helper methods for client creation

## Testing Coverage

The enhancements have improved test coverage across several areas:

- **Auth Client**: Added token validation and error handling tests
- **Transfer Client**: Added comprehensive test suite for all client methods
- **Edge Cases**: Added tests for error conditions and edge scenarios
- **Interface Adapters**: Ensured proper compatibility between interface implementations

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Add more comprehensive integration tests
2. Implement more advanced token refresh strategies
3. Add rate limiting and retry functionality
4. Optimize HTTP client configuration
5. Enhance logging and tracing capabilities
