# PR Summary: API Stability Phase 2 Implementation

This PR completes the API Stability Phase 2 implementation for the Globus Go SDK. It introduces comprehensive API compatibility verification tools, enhances the testing framework, and improves code organization.

## Key Components

### 1. API Stability Tools

- **API Signature Generation**: Added `cmd/apigen` tool to generate API signatures for packages
- **API Compatibility Checking**: Added `cmd/apicompare` tool to compare APIs between versions
- **Deprecation Tracking**: Added `cmd/depreport` tool to generate deprecation reports
- **Contract Testing**: Added framework for behavioral contract verification in `pkg/core/contracts`

### 2. Documentation

- **API Stability Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation:
  - `API_STABILITY_PHASE2_SUMMARY.md`: Details of Phase 2 implementation
  - `API_DEPRECATION_SYSTEM.md`: Documentation of the deprecation system
  - `CONTRACT_TESTING.md`: Guide to the contract testing system
  - `RELEASE_PLAN_V0.9.17.md`: Plan for the v0.9.17 release
  - Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with Phase 2 changes

### 3. Code Organization

- **Command-Line Tools**: Moved utility scripts to proper `cmd/` directories:
  - `cmd/debug-interfaces`: Debug tool for interfaces
  - `cmd/simulate-downstream`: Tool for testing downstream project compatibility
  - `cmd/validate-imports`: Tool for checking import cycles
  - `cmd/verify-connection-fix`: Tool for verifying connection pool fixes
  - `cmd/verify-pool-functions`: Tool for testing connection pool functions
- **Internal Package**: Created `internal/verification` package for shared code
- **Code Fixes**: 
  - Fixed package conflicts in debug files
  - Resolved function redeclarations
  - Updated auth and transfer client usage
  - Replaced deprecated code
  - Fixed imports in compute example files

## Verification

- **API Compatibility**: Verified no breaking changes from v0.9.16
- **Pre-commit Checks**: All pre-commit hooks pass, including go vet
- **Contract Tests**: Interface contracts validated

## Impact

This PR significantly enhances the SDK's API stability by:

1. Providing tools to verify API compatibility between versions
2. Documenting the API stability guarantees and processes
3. Implementing a runtime deprecation warning system
4. Establishing a foundation for comprehensive contract testing
5. Improving code organization for better maintainability

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged, we'll:

1. Tag the v0.9.17 release
2. Update the release documentation
3. Begin planning for Phase 3 implementation
4. Start working toward the v0.10.0 release

## Screenshots

No UI changes are included in this PR.

## Testing

- All go vet checks pass
- API compatibility verification passes
- All unit tests pass
- Manually tested all new command-line tools
