## Known Limitations for v0.8.0

- Some advanced features of the Globus services may not be fully implemented
- Integration testing requires user-provided credentials
- Performance optimizations are scheduled for v0.9.0
- Some service-specific features are minimal implementations
- API interfaces may change before v1.0.0

## Workarounds for Current Issues

1. **Import Cycles**: Use the standalone credential verification tool to test credentials
2. **Duplicate Methods**: Only use methods from the main service client files
3. **Compilation Errors**: Build only the needed packages or use the standalone tool

## Making the SDK Generally Available

1. **Go Module Publishing**
   - [ ] Ensure go.mod is correctly configured
   - [ ] Verify module path matches GitHub repository
   - [ ] Test installation via `go get`
   - [ ] Verify compatibility with different Go versions (1.18+)

2. **Documentation Publishing**
   - [ ] Ensure GoDoc comments are comprehensive
   - [ ] Verify pkg.go.dev correctly renders documentation
   - [ ] Consider GitHub Pages for additional documentation

3. **Distribution and Discovery**
   - [ ] Add appropriate repository topics for discoverability
   - [ ] Create social media announcements for releases
   - [ ] Reach out to relevant Go newsletters and forums
   - [ ] Consider writing a blog post about the SDK

4. **Support Plan**
   - [ ] Establish issue response SLAs
   - [ ] Create process for security vulnerability reporting
   - [ ] Plan regular maintenance releases
   - [ ] Set up automated dependency scanning
