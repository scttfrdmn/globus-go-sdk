# Tokens Package Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a new `tokens` package for the Globus Go SDK that provides comprehensive token management for OAuth2 tokens. This package addresses the missing `tokens` package dependency in the webapp example.

## What Was Implemented

1. **Core Tokens Package**:
   - Created a new package under `pkg/services/tokens`
   - Implemented the `TokenSet` and `Entry` structs
   - Created a `Storage` interface for token persistence
   - Added implementations for `MemoryStorage` and `FileStorage`
   - Implemented a `Manager` for automatic token refreshing
   - Added support for background token refresh

2. **Webapp Integration**:
   - Updated the webapp example to use the new tokens package
   - Implemented proper error handling for token operations
   - Added background token refresh for improved user experience

3. **Additional Fixes**:
   - Added missing constant definitions to the auth package
   - Implemented `UserInfo` struct and methods in the auth package
   - Created a simplified search implementation for the webapp example
   - Fixed various compilation issues and improper references

## Implementation Details

### Token Storage

The tokens package provides two storage implementations:

1. `MemoryStorage`: In-memory storage for tokens, suitable for testing or simple applications
2. `FileStorage`: File-based storage that persists tokens to disk, allowing them to survive application restarts

Both implementations are thread-safe and provide the same interface for token operations.

### Token Manager

The `Manager` handles token storage, retrieval, and automatic refreshing. It provides:

- Automatic token refresh when tokens are near expiry
- Background refresh capability with configurable intervals
- Configurable refresh thresholds
- Thread-safe operation for concurrent use

### Authentication Integration

The tokens package integrates with the auth package to handle token refresh operations. The auth client implements the `RefreshHandler` interface, allowing the token manager to use it for token refreshing.

## Testing

We've successfully compiled the webapp example, verifying that our implementation addresses the dependency issue. The example now uses the tokens package for token storage and management.

## Next Steps

1. **Add Unit Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for the tokens package
   - Implement tests for both storage implementations
   - Test token refresh functionality
   - Test background refresh

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add detailed GoDoc documentation to the tokens package
   - Create examples for different use cases
   - Document security considerations

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Add more storage backends (Redis, database)
   - Implement token encryption for improved security
   - Add token usage statistics

## Conclusion

The implementation of the tokens package addresses the dependency issue in the webapp example and provides a robust foundation for token management in the Globus Go SDK. It follows the same design patterns as the rest of the SDK and should be easy to maintain and extend.
