# Tokens Package Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a new `tokens` package for the Globus Go SDK that provides comprehensive token management for OAuth2 tokens. This package addresses the missing `tokens` package dependency in the webapp example.

## What Was Implemented

1. **Core Tokens Package**:
   - Created a new package under `pkg/services/tokens`
   - Implemented the `TokenSet` and `Entry` structs
   - Created a `Storage` interface for token persistence
   - Added implementations for `MemoryStorage` and `FileStorage`
   - Implemented a `Manager` for automatic token refreshing
   - Added support for background token refresh

2. **Webapp Integration**:
   - Updated the webapp example to use the new tokens package
   - Implemented proper error handling for token operations
   - Added background token refresh for improved user experience

3. **Additional Fixes**:
   - Added missing constant definitions to the auth package
   - Implemented `UserInfo` struct and methods in the auth package
   - Created a simplified search implementation for the webapp example
   - Fixed various compilation issues and improper references

## Implementation Details

### Token Storage

The tokens package provides two storage implementations:

1. `MemoryStorage`: In-memory storage for tokens, suitable for testing or simple applications
2. `FileStorage`: File-based storage that persists tokens to disk, allowing them to survive application restarts

Both implementations are thread-safe and provide the same interface for token operations.

### Token Manager

The `Manager` handles token storage, retrieval, and automatic refreshing. It provides:

- Automatic token refresh when tokens are near expiry
- Background refresh capability with configurable intervals
- Configurable refresh thresholds
- Thread-safe operation for concurrent use

### Authentication Integration

The tokens package integrates with the auth package to handle token refresh operations. The auth client implements the `RefreshHandler` interface, allowing the token manager to use it for token refreshing.

## Testing

We've successfully compiled the webapp example, verifying that our implementation addresses the dependency issue. The example now uses the tokens package for token storage and management.

## Implementation Complete

We have now completed the implementation of the tokens package, including:

1. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
   - Added comprehensive unit tests for all components
   - Implemented integration tests with real Globus credentials
   - Added test for thread safety and concurrent operations
   - Tested both memory and file storage implementations
   - Verified token refresh functionality
   - Tested background refresh capability

2. **Documentation**:
   - Added detailed GoDoc documentation to the tokens package
   - Created token-management example for different use cases
   - Created tokens-package.md with detailed documentation
   - Updated token-storage.md with references to the new package
   - Documented security considerations and best practices

3. **Examples and Testing Tools**:
   - Created a robust token management example
   - Added support for mock implementations for testing
   - Implemented test scripts for validating with real credentials
   - Updated the webapp example to use the new tokens package

## Achievements

1. **Fixed Dependency Issue**: The webapp example now uses the properly implemented tokens package
2. **Comprehensive Token Management**: Provided a complete solution for storing, retrieving, and refreshing tokens
3. **Thread Safety**: All implementations are thread-safe and suitable for concurrent use
4. **Flexible Storage Options**: Provided both memory and file-based storage options
5. **Automatic Token Refresh**: Implemented auto-refresh based on configurable thresholds
6. **Background Refresh**: Added proactive token refresh for long-running applications

## Integration Completed

The tokens package is now fully integrated with:
- Auth service for token refreshing
- Webapp example for demonstration of token management
- Comprehensive testing framework for validation

## Status

The tokens package implementation is now complete and ready for the v0.8.0 release. All requirements have been met and the package has been verified with real Globus credentials.

## Recent Enhancements (2025-05-03)

### API Consistency Improvements

We've enhanced the tokens package with the functional options pattern to ensure API consistency across all service clients:

1. **Functional Options Pattern**:
   - Created `options.go` file for the tokens package
   - Implemented ClientOption type and option functions
   - Added various configuration options like WithStorage, WithRefreshHandler, WithAuthClient
   - Updated NewManager constructor to use the options pattern

2. **SDK Integration**:
   - Updated `globus.go` with new methods for token manager creation:
     - NewTokenManager: Creates a token manager with custom options
     - NewTokenManagerWithAuth: Creates a token manager with an auth client for refreshing
   - Added TokensScope constant for consistency with other services
   - Ensured proper error handling and propagation

3. **Example Updates**:
   - Updated token-management example to use the new functional options
   - Demonstrated usage with both real and mock implementations
   - Improved error handling throughout examples

4. **Benefits**:
   - Consistent API experience across all service clients
   - More flexible configuration options
   - Better error handling and validation
   - Simplified usage in the SDK and applications

The tokens package now fully aligns with the API consistency requirements established for the SDK v0.8.0 release.
