# HTTP Pool API Availability Testing

This document summarizes the tests added to ensure that HTTP pool API functions are properly exported and available to dependent projects.

## Problem Description

Issue #11 revealed that some HTTP pool functions were not properly exported, causing compilation errors in dependent projects that relied on these functions, specifically:

- `httppool.NewHttpConnectionPoolManager` was undefined

## Solution

We have implemented a comprehensive testing strategy to catch these issues early, with the following components:

### 1. HTTP Pool API Tests

- Created `pkg/core/http/pool_api_test.go` to verify that all required HTTP pool functions are properly defined and exported.
- Tests include:
  - Function availability checks
  - Interface implementation verification
  - Global pool manager availability
  - Practical usage tests that match patterns used in the SDK

### 2. Connection Pool Integration Tests

- Added `pkg/connection_pools_test.go` to test the integration between the connection pools and the SDK clients.
- These tests verify:
  - Connection pool initialization
  - Service client integration with pools
  - Proper initialization of all service pools

### 3. Package Export Verification Tool

- Created `scripts/verify_package_exports.go` which provides a standalone tool to verify required exports.
- This tool checks:
  - Critical function availability
  - Correct interface implementations
  - Practical usage of the connection pool API
- Added a shell script wrapper `scripts/verify_exports.sh` for easy CI integration

### 4. CI Integration

- Updated GitHub Actions workflows to run these tests automatically:
  - HTTP pool API tests
  - Connection pool integration tests
  - Package export verification

## Key Learnings

1. **Interface Implementation Verification**: We discovered that `reflect.TypeOf().Implements()` can sometimes give false negatives due to method signature comparison nuances. Using direct type assertions (`_, ok := interface{}(x).(Interface)`) is more reliable.

2. **Comprehensive API Testing**: Testing both the API availability and its practical usage patterns helps catch issues that might otherwise only be discovered when used by dependent projects.

3. **Standalone Verification Tools**: Having a dedicated tool to verify package exports makes it easier to catch export-related issues early in the development process.

## Future Work

These tests should be maintained and expanded to cover any new or modified HTTP pool functions. When adding new features to the connection pool API, corresponding tests should be added to ensure proper exportation and availability.
