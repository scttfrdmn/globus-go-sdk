# Security Audit Plan

This document outlines the plan for conducting a comprehensive security audit of the Globus Go SDK. The audit will focus on identifying potential security issues, ensuring best practices are followed, and providing recommendations for improvements.

## Audit Scope

The security audit will cover the following areas:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**: Review of authentication flows, token handling, and authorization mechanisms
2. **Data Protection**: Review of data handling, encryption, and secure storage
3. **Transport Security**: Analysis of network communication security
4. **Input Validation**: Verification of proper input validation across the codebase
5. **Error Handling**: Assessment of error handling patterns to prevent information leakage
6. **Dependency Management**: Review of external dependencies and their security implications
7. **Code Quality**: Evaluation of code patterns that might lead to security issues
8. **Documentation**: Review of security-related documentation

## Audit Methodology

### 1. Automated Analysis

- Run static code analysis tools focused on security:
  - [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)
  - [nancy](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy) (for dependency scanning)
  - Standard Go tools: `go vet`, `golangci-lint`

- Configure continuous scanning in CI/CD pipeline

### 2. Manual Code Review

Perform manual review of security-critical areas:

- **Authentication**:
  - Token handling and storage
  - OAuth2 flow implementations
  - MFA support implementation

- **Data Security**:
  - Sensitive data handling
  - Logging and error reporting
  - Data encryption

- **Network Security**:
  - TLS configuration
  - API request/response handling
  - Header management

### 3. Penetration Testing

- Attempt to exploit potential vulnerabilities
- Test error handling under adverse conditions
- Verify proper implementation of authentication flows

### 4. Documentation Review

- Check documentation for security-related guidance
- Ensure best practices are properly documented
- Identify missing security documentation

## Focus Areas

### Authentication and Authorization

- Review token storage mechanisms
- Analyze token refresh implementation
- Verify proper scope handling
- Assess MFA implementation security
- Check authorization header handling

### Data Protection

- Review handling of sensitive data
- Verify data is properly redacted in logs
- Evaluate secure storage implementations
- Check for potential data leakage

### Transport Security

- Review TLS configuration
- Verify certificate validation
- Check for proper use of HTTPS
- Evaluate header security

### Input Validation

- Verify validation of user input
- Check for potential injection vulnerabilities
- Review path handling for directory traversal
- Assess query parameter validation

### Error Handling

- Verify errors don't leak sensitive information
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Review error logging practices

### Dependency Management

- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Review dependency update practices
- Check for minimal dependency usage
