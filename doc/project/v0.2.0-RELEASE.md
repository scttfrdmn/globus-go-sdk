# Globus Go SDK v0.2.0 Release

We're excited to announce the release of Globus Go SDK v0.2.0, a significant update that introduces several new features, performance improvements, and enhanced reliability.

## Release Highlights

### Enhanced Performance and Reliability

This release introduces significant improvements for performance and reliability:

- **Connection Pooling**: Service-specific connection pools optimize network performance.
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents API throttling issues.
- **Backoff Strategies**: Exponential backoff with jitter improves resilience.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures.

### Improved Observability

The SDK now provides comprehensive observability features:

- **Structured Logging**: Text and JSON format support with field-based contextual logging.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Trace ID propagation across service boundaries.
- **Automatic Redaction**: Sensitive data is automatically redacted from logs.

### Advanced Transfer Capabilities

Transfer functionality has been significantly enhanced:

- **Resumable Transfers**: Checkpoint-based transfers that can be paused and resumed.
- **Memory Optimization**: Memory-efficient handling of large transfers.
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress monitoring and reporting.
- **Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry mechanism for failed transfers.

### Developer Tooling

We've added several tools to improve the developer experience:

- **Credential Verification**: Utility for testing Globus credentials against all services.
- **Integration Testing**: Enhanced testing infrastructure with real-world examples.
- **Example Applications**: New examples demonstrating SDK capabilities.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for all major features.

## Who Should Use This Release?

This release is ideal for:

- Applications transferring large files or directories with Globus
- Services that need to interact with multiple Globus APIs
- Developers building automation workflows with Globus Flows
- Applications requiring reliable operation even with unstable networks

## Getting Started

To use the Globus Go SDK in your Go application:

```bash
go get github.com/scttfrdmn/globus-go-sdk@v0.2.0
```

Basic usage example:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/scttfrdmn/globus-go-sdk/pkg"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new SDK configuration
    config := pkg.NewConfig().
        WithClientID("your-client-id").
        WithClientSecret("your-client-secret")

    // Create an auth client
    authClient := config.NewAuthClient()

    // Get a token using client credentials
    ctx := context.Background()
    token, err := authClient.GetClientCredentialsToken(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get token: %v", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Successfully obtained token: %s\n", token.AccessToken)

    // Create a transfer client
    transferClient := config.NewTransferClient(token.AccessToken)

    // List endpoints
    endpoints, err := transferClient.ListEndpoints(ctx, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to list endpoints: %v", err)
    }

    fmt.Printf("Found %d endpoints\n", len(endpoints))
    for _, endpoint := range endpoints {
        fmt.Printf("- %s (%s)\n", endpoint.DisplayName, endpoint.ID)
    }
}
```
